# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
    With the help of statistical models, I explored the API structure and identified trends and patterns in data.

## Process
    API-based data access
    Data cleaning and transformation
    Data loading into a database
    Conducting EDAs
    Analyzing data using statistical models to identify trends and patterns
    Analyzing and interpreting statistical results

## Results
    According to 'Rating' as an attribute (POI), cafeterias such as hotels, bakeries, and restaurants are ranked in the top three
    In terms of popularity as an attribute (POI), Miscellaneous Stores & Shopping Malls rank high

## Challenges 
    I struggled to obtain the Fusion Authentication code (Yelp) since I am out of the country
    After retrying for several hours, I eventually used the VPN

## Future Goals
    As the adjusted R-squared value was relatively low (21.7%), I would like to explore the regression model with additional independent variables (POIs)
