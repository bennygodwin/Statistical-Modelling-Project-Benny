# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
    With the help of statistical models, I explored the API structure and identified trends and patterns in data.

## Process
- API-based data access
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Data loading into a database
- Conducting EDAs
- Analyzing data using statistical models to identify trends and patterns
- Analyzing and interpreting statistical results

## Results
According to 'Rating' as an attribute (POI), cafeterias such as hotels, bakeries, and restaurants are ranked in the top three

In terms of popularity as an attribute (POI), Miscellaneous Stores & Shopping Malls rank high

## Challenges 
I struggled to obtain the Fusion Authentication code (Yelp) since I am out of the country

After retrying for several hours, I eventually used the VPN

## Future Goals
As the adjusted R-squared value was relatively low (21.7%), I would like to explore the regression model with additional independent variables (POIs)
